# Crypto_Analysis
cryptanalysis to perform frequency analysis on input ciphertext

The main objective of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface for performing frequency analysis on input ciphertext. Frequency analysis is a technique used in cryptanalysis to identify patterns and frequencies of characters, digrams, and trigrams in a given ciphertext. These patterns can then be utilized to decrypt the text, particularly in the case of simple substitution ciphers.
